# Bus ETA Report for Fridge

This was made because it was annoying to take out phone and check how long until bus arrives and then run down when it was too late. With this, the users can be constantly reminded when to leave home.

First (Useful to public) project by yours truly.

Made by a human who had a bunch of ttgo e-ink stuff collecting dust and wanted a break from working on his charger.

Clock function is **not** here for a reason. Don't bother asking me.
